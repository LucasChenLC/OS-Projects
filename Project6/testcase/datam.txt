The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, translated by Bakunin, was published early in the â€˜sixties by the printing office of the Kolokol [a reference to the Free Russian Printing House]. Then the West could see in it (the Russian edition of the Manifesto) only a literary curiosity. Such a view would be impossible today.
